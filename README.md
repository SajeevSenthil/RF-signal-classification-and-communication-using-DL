RF Modulation Classification and Communication System Simulation Using Deep Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project integrates deep learning-based RF modulation classification with a real-time wireless communication simulation. We first classify RF signals using a trained deep learning model and then dynamically select the appropriate modulation scheme for communication. The system encodes and transmits data using the chosen modulation, which is subsequently received and decoded at the receiver.

ðŸ”¥ Features
RF Signal Classification: Uses deep learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow) to classify modulation schemes.
Dynamic Modulation Selection: Adapts modulation techniques based on classification results.
Data Transmission & Reception: Encodes, transmits, and decodes data in MATLAB.
Seamless Python-MATLAB Integration: Trained models in Python are imported into MATLAB for signal processing.
ðŸš€ Workflow
Train & Classify RF Signal:

Use deep learning (CNN/RNN/Transformers) to classify modulation schemes.
Dataset: RadioML 2018.01A (processed as time-series IQ samples).
Select Modulation Scheme Dynamically:

Based on classified modulation, choose an optimal transmission scheme.
Encode & Transmit Data:

Simulate data encoding and RF transmission in MATLAB.
Apply modulation techniques (e.g., QPSK, BPSK, 16-QAM).
Receive & Decode Signal:

Capture transmitted signal at the receiver.
Perform demodulation and decoding for data retrieval.
